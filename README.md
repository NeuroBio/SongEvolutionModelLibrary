# Song Evolution Model (C#)

## Overview
This is the C# version of an agent-based model designed to simulate how different evolutionary pressures affect song and song learning.

## Documentation
The Walkthrough explains the logic behind the model (Section 1), a Vignette to start using the models (Section 2.4) and includes
extensive function documentations (Section 3).  New users should focus on Sections 1 and 2.4.  Users wishing to use the premade
programs should see the programs repository.  Users wishing to make their own programs should see Section 2.5.
Users wishing to extend the model should see Section 3.
